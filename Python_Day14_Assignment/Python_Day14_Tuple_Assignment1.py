#1. Write a Python program to find the number of times 4 appears in the tuple. 

#Input: tuplex = (2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7 ) Output: 3 
# Define the tuple
tuplex = (2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)

# Count the occurrences of the number 4
count_of_4 = tuplex.count(4)

# Print the result
print(count_of_4)

#output: 3
